                We&rsquo;ve been experimenting with using the fruit from
                Syzygium luehmannii in wine making for some years now, initially
                with other fruits. We found the Australian native deserved to
                shine all by itself.
              </p>

                It has a unique spicy tone with an aromatic flavour. Our
                sparkling is made in a p√©tillant naturel style and it is just
                the thing to mark a celebration or have as a little sundowner
                with some cheese.
              </p>

                Syzygium leuhmanii is a type of Lilly Pilly and is one of the
                most robust and popular native plants. It has diverse uses and
                doesn&rsquo;t require high intensity care which makes it a
                perfect sustainable crop for the future. We&rsquo;re aspiring to
                have a farm that embraces regenerative agriculture and is part
                of a positive solution for productive lands.
              </p>
              <p>
                We hope you enjoy this totally unique wine as much as we do!
